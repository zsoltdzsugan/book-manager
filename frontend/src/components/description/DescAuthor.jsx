                    <p>James Islington was born and raised in southern Victoria, Australia. His influences growing up were the stories of Raymond E. Feist and Robert Jordan, but it wasn"t until later, when he read Brandon Sanderson"s Mistborn series - followed soon after by Patrick Rothfuss" Name of the Wind - that he was finally inspired to sit down and write something of his own. He now lives with his wife and two children on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria.</p>
